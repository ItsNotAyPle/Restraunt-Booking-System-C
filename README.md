# C Restraunt Booking System
A pratice first C project using nothing more than the C standard libary and not copying existing alorithms from google. Database is just a manual json file (no MySQL).
Archiving for now as i want to work on other projects. Potentially i'll do it again in the future with gui and better alogrithms
